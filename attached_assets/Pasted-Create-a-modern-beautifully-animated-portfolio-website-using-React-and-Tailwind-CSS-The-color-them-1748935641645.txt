Create a modern, beautifully animated portfolio website using React and Tailwind CSS. The color theme should be strictly monochrome: black, dark gray, light gray, and white. Use smooth transitions, Framer Motion animations, and soft shadows. The layout should be minimalist, elegant, and mobile-responsive.

My portfolio website should include the following sections:

Hero Section:

Full-screen intro with my name, title (e.g., "Full Stack Developer | UI/UX Enthusiast"), and a short tagline.

Animated background (e.g., gradient glow or particle effect) in grayscale.

Framer Motion entrance animations for text.

About Me Section:

Short bio with my image (grayscale image with subtle hover effect).

Include a list of technologies I work with.

Smooth fade-in on scroll.

Projects Section:

Cards or tiles for each project (animated on hover).

Each project includes image, title, short description, tech stack, and links to GitHub/live site.

Animate each card on scroll using Framer Motion.

Skills Section:

Beautiful grid layout or animated progress bars.

Hover effect on each skill tile with grayscale glow.

Contact Section:

Clean contact form (name, email, message).

Include social icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email) in grayscale with hover interaction.

Subtle fade-in animation.

Footer:

Simple black footer with copyright.

Use smooth grayscale gradients, glassmorphism or frosted backgrounds, and elegant Framer Motion transitions throughout the site. The site should reflect a futuristic, professional tone while remaining minimal.
